# Explanation
# ===========
# task.status == 0     <- Task is not 'completed' (3 otherwise)
# task.type == 1       <- 'Task' is not _actually_ a Project
# task.trashed == 0    <- Task is not trashed
# task.type == 0       <- Task is not a project (1 otherwise)
# task.start == 1      <- Task is either Today or Anytime (not Someday or Scheduled)
# project.start == 1   <- Project, in which the Task is, is either  Today or Anytime (not Someday or Scheduled)
#                         Using 'LEFT JOIN' to make sure to include Tasks not in a Project (directly in Area)
#
# What is 'actionGroup'?
# ----------------------
# When a task is within a heading, it won't have a 'project' ID,
# instead it will have an 'actionGroup' ID, and this 'actionGroup' ID will have the 'project' ID.
